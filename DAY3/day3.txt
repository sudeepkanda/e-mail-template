learned CSS and applied a wide range of attributes
  I tried many things div centering background image, selector, property, value;
  if id number we should use [id="123"]{ }
.class_name{ }
text-decoration*** color type decoration name;
font-family: serif, sanserif, cursive is love, fantasy,monoscope;
spent most of the time in implementation just uploading code that remained at the end 
  as I deleted most of the code to implement new things
